# Pipesock

A websocket server you can pipe to.

To get going, create `~/.pipesock` on your home directoy, and then move the default folder inside.

Other views can also live there

    tail -f "some.log" | go run pipesock.go 
    
The server will be there on port `:9193`.

Accessing `/flush` will clear the buffer.

The websocket can connect to `/ws` and receive serialized messages in the format:

    {
      Time: Timestamp for broadcast,
      Messages: [
        {
         Time: Timestamp for readline,
         Message: Message string
         }
         ....
      ]
    }

The array of buffered messages can be read in JSON format at `/buffer.json`.
